## Introduction

This repository includes a series of C++ modules from the 42 School curriculum, each focusing on different aspects of the C++ programming language. These modules are structured to progressively build your understanding and skills in C++. Each module includes source code files and, where applicable, sample programs to illustrate key concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- You have a text editor or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any other IDE of your choice).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
